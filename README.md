#  Bullet Hell game for F21GP module
This is a module taught at Heriot-Watt University

##  Assignment Details
The purpose of this assignment is to go thorugh the game development process as if working in the real world.
This involves coming up with and developing game ideas, gathering user feedback and incorporating this back into the product.
I have chosen a "bullet hell" style game, where the user must dodge patterns of oncoming bullets while navigating a simple maze to complete the level.
This won't be particularlly glamorous, unless I choose to develop it further down the line.

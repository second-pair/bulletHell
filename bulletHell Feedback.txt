Spaceship too large, hotbox is off <- scaled spaceship to accommodate
Spaceship too snappy <- added weighting of new acceleration to old
Spaceship too "slow" <- adjusted acceleration scale so ship responds faster to a given tilt
Bullets are too random <- Drew up plans for bullet patterns
Bullets should move in non-static ways <- Added plans for local bullet movement to bullet patterns
Found possible to clip through wall-border edges moving vertically <- added game wall padding
No "end-state" <- added exit goal to complete the level

TODO:
More levels <- look into producing a level-progression system upon reaching the exit
Game world may then become too small <- looking in to having scrolling stage
Game over system <- looking into programming a game over and highscore system
Health pickup system <- determine how much to add, fixed positions vs random spawns near player (people saying random spawns cooler, fixed positions better design)
Having to hold phone horizontally is difficult <- looking to use different plane
Add "walls are lava" <- should implement knock back + life lost
Bullets carry on being spawned while "paused" <- look into this
Add ship rotation to follow movement
No reset system <- look into resetting the game once cleared
Issue where bullet spawns will stack while app is in background

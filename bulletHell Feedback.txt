Spaceship too large, hotbox is off <- scaled spaceship to accommodate
Spaceship too snappy <- added weighting of new acceleration to old
Spaceship too "slow" <- adjusted acceleration scale so ship responds faster to a given tilt

Bullets should move in non-static ways <- Added plans for local bullet movement to bullet patterns
